            <h3>Add Drupal Packagist</h3>
            <p>
                For being able to add any Drupal project (module, theme, drush
                extension) to your composer project, you have to add the
                Drupal Packagist to your root <em>composer.json</em>'s repository section:
            </p>
            <pre>
    {
      "repositories": [
        {
          "type": "composer",
          "url": "https://packagist.drupal-composer.org"
        }
      ]
    }
            </pre>
            <h3>Kickstart</h3>
            <p>
                We provide project templates for an easy start. Look at
                <a href="https://github.com/drupal-composer/drupal-project">drupal-composer/drupal-project</a>

        <div>
            <p>
                Basically Drupal Packagist will work for <em>Drupal 8</em> and
                <em>Drupal 7</em> projects.
            </p>
            <h3>Composer installers</h3>
            <p>
                In general you will need to add a <a
                    href="https://github.com/composer/installers">Composer
                    Installer</a> to your project
                so modules, themes, profiles and drush extensions are downloaded
                to
                the correct directories, dependent on your Drupal installation.
            </p>
            <h3>Adding modules, themes, â€¦</h3>
            <p>
                Besides that, you can use <code>composer install</code>, <code>composer
                    require</code>,
                <code>composer update</code> and <code>composer remove</code>
                like with
                any other composer package.
            </p>
            <pre>
   "require": [
     {
       "drupal/views": "^7.3.0",
       "drupal/radix": "7.*",
       "drupal/master": "7.3.*"
     }
   ]
            </pre>
            <h3>Documentation</h3>
            <p>
                <a href="https://www.drupal.org/node/2404989">Documentation on drupal.org</a> was started
                but is far from complete. Any help is welcome to improve the
                situation there.
