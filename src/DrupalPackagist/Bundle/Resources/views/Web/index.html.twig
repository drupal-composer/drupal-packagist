                <h2>Learn about Composer</h2>
                <p>
                  For getting started with Composer in general, please visit the
                  <a href="https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md">offical documentation</a>.

                <h2>Add Drupal Packagist</h2>
                <p>
                  For being able to add any Drupal project (module, theme, drush extension)
                  to your composer project, you have to add the Drupal Packagist to your root
                  <em>composer.json</em>'s repository section:
                </p>
                <pre>
{
  "repositories": [
    {
      "type": "composer",
      "url": "http://packagist.drupal-composer.org"
    }
  ]
}
</pre>
                <h2>Kickstart</h2>
                <p>
                  We provide project templates for an easy start. Look at
                  <a href="https://github.com/drupal-composer/drupal-project">drupal-composer/drupal-project</a> for details.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Visit <a href="http://drupal-composer.org/">drupal-composer.org</a> for a general overview on the subject.

                Basically Drupal Packagist will work for <em>Drupal 7</em> and
                <em>Drupal 8</em> projects.
              </p>
              <h2>Composer installers</h2>
              <p>
                In general you will need to add a Composer Installer to your project
                (like <a href="https://github.com/davidbarratt/custom-installer">davidbarratt/custom-installer</a>
                or <a href="https://github.com/davidbarratt/custom-installer">composer/installers</a>),
                so modules, themes, profiles and drush extensions are downloaded to
                the correct directories, dependent on your Drupal installation.
                </ul>
              </p>
              <h2>Adding modules, themes, â€¦</h2>
              <p>
                Besides that, you can use <code>composer install</code>, <code>composer require</code>,
                <code>composer update</code> and <code>composer remove</code> like with
                any other composer package.
