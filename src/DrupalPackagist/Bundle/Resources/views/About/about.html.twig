            <p>Drupal Packagist is a fork of Packagist. If you would like to support our upstream project, the best way is to check out <a href="https://toranproxy.com">Toran Proxy</a> and buy a license. It can help you install packages fast and reliably, provides you with a private package repository, and the money goes towards Composer and Packagist maintenance!</p>
